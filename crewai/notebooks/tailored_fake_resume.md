**Professional Experience**  

**DataKernel – Director of Software Engineering (Remote)**  
*2022 – Present*  
- Architected a scalable, event-driven application framework using CQRS to separate read and write operations, improving system performance by 40% under high load and reducing data contention.  
- Designed and implemented a distributed messaging backbone using RabbitMQ and AWS SNS to route events between microservices, enabling real-time processing and decoupling of components for improved fault tolerance and observability.  
- Implemented Redis-based distributed caching to reduce response times by 70%, directly applicable to .NET Core applications requiring low-latency access to frequently accessed data.  
- Led migration of legacy systems to AWS, including containerization via ECS and serverless functions (Lambda), ensuring compliance with cloud-native best practices and operational scalability.  
- Owned technical governance for AI-driven data pipelines, defining standards for data flow, error handling, and system monitoring—directly transferable to enterprise-level technical roadmap and compliance requirements.  
- Collaborated with product and operations teams to define system boundaries, performance thresholds, and deployment strategies, ensuring alignment with business and engineering objectives.  

**CrewAI – Founder & Lead Developer**  
*2022 – Present (Self-Managed, Open-Source Leadership)*  
- Designed and implemented CrewAI, an open-source framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents in role-based workflows (e.g., researcher, planner, executor), enabling complex, multi-step problem-solving through structured, human-like collaboration.  
- Translated these workflows into scalable, event-driven architectures that mirror CQRS and event bus patterns—using event propagation, failure detection, and retry logic to ensure system resilience and self-healing behavior.  
- Integrated CrewAI with Amazon Bedrock to build production-grade agentic systems for enterprise applications, demonstrating experience in deploying AI systems with clear architectural boundaries and governance.  
- Developed a system that monitors agent performance and escalates failures to human oversight—directly aligning with the need for robust monitoring, alerting, and fault tolerance in production systems.  

**InnovPet – Founder & CEO (Remote)**  
*2019 – 2022*  
- Led end-to-end product development of an IoT-based pet tracking system, leveraging event-driven design principles to manage real-time GPS data ingestion and processing.  
- Designed a distributed system using event-driven patterns (event bus, event sourcing) to handle device updates, location changes, and battery alerts—ensuring timely delivery and system resilience.  
- Implemented a cloud-based data pipeline using AWS S3, SNS, and Lambda to process and store sensor data, demonstrating hands-on experience with cloud event processing and scalable data handling.  

**EliteDevs – Engineering Manager (Remote)**  
*2018 – 2019*  
- Spearheaded a shift toward event-driven architecture for a new product, using React and React-Redux to manage state propagation and real-time updates—aligning with reactive patterns in modern web applications.  
- Improved team velocity by 30% through clear architectural documentation and standardization of event handling and API contracts—directly supporting cross-team collaboration and technical governance.  

**PrintPack – Engineering Manager (Remote)**  
*2016 – 2018*  
- Led a high-performance engineering team that increased revenue by 500% in two years through data-driven product decisions.  
- Implemented predictive modeling for customer behavior using event-based analytics—demonstrating experience in building systems that react to user actions and adapt over time.  

**DriveAI – Senior Software Engineer (Remote)**  
*2015 – 2016*  
- Developed and optimized a central API with advanced caching strategies using Redis, reducing response times by 70% and lowering system load under peak traffic—directly relevant to performance-critical .NET Core applications.  

**BetCraft – CTO (Remote)**  
*2013 – 2015*  
- Led technology strategy for a scalable frontend platform using React and Angular, establishing a foundation for a modular, event-based UI architecture that supports dynamic content updates and user interaction.

*Note: While I have no direct hands-on development experience with ASP.NET Core, MVC, Razor Pages, or gRPC, I possess deep architectural and systems-level understanding of the core principles behind these technologies—including separation of concerns, event handling, and distributed service communication. My experience in building event-driven, resilient, and self-correcting systems—particularly through CrewAI and cloud-native event processing—directly aligns with the requirements for a Principal Application Architect in a .NET or cloud-native environment. I bring a proven ability to design, own, and govern complex systems with clear technical vision, operational clarity, and enterprise alignment.*
